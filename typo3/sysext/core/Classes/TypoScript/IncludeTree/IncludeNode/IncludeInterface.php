 * is for instance "SysTemplateInclude" for a node that represents a sys_template
 * row, and DefaultTypoScriptInclude for the default TypoScript string included from

 *
 * Nodes may have children, and a single stream of lines from the tokenizer
 * may be split into multiple children: Each @import creates an own child node,
